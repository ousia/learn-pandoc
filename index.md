# Learn `pandoc`

_Learn `pandoc`_ is _An Introduction to Digital Editing_. [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org) is a tool that converts simple text files between different formats. [John MacFarlane](http://johnmacfarlane.net/) is its main developer.

This extraordinary fast tool allows the development of a system for digital editing. The content from _Learn `pandoc`_ shows how to achieve it.

The book is also _An Introduction to Digital Editing_, since it describes a way to digitally edit texts from a single source file which contains the text. Theory is explained in [_A Single Source_](http://www.a-single-source.tk). Code—or simply practice—is explained in these pages.

## Work Structure

The book contains four relevant parts in which digital editing is explained:

* `pandoc`, the tool that deals with al kinds of conversions.

* ePub, the standard for electronic books.

* <span class="tex-logo">ConTeXt</span>, the program that generates high–quality PDF documents. These PDF documents are intended for printing. Printing may take place in a copy shop or in a real printing house. It all depends on the budget, not on the program.

* `git`, a control versioning system to be deployed with texts. It is an essential tool to deal with texts professionally and it also helps to focus on the task of writing.

## Download

The book is only in its early stages. It is a very rough draft. It needs composition and polishing. I’m afraid that I don’t have time enough to write faster.

I hope to upload a draft version with the complete table of contents as soon as possible. Of course, text will be missing in that early version.

It you find any flaw or you have something to comment, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ousia/learn-pandoc/issues/new).
